        - data_input: This is the string data that needs to be encrypted or
        decrypted. This is None if the data is coming in from a file.

        decrypted. This is None if the data is not coming from a file and is
        provided directly.

        moment the program supports printing to the console or writing to
        another text file.
        - key: The Key value to use for encryption or decryption.

        decryption. This does not usually come in with the request.
